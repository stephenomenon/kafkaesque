##### A Word About Vendoring
I've used the govendor tool from <https://github.com/kardianos/govendor> to manage some third-party packages in this project.
These third-party packages must be downloaded prior to building this app. 
If you also take advantage of the govendor tool, you can download everything you need by entering the `govendor sync` command from the project's directory.
